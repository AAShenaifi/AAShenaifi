# Hi, I’m Abdullah Al-Shenaifi 👋  
**Electronics & Embedded Systems Engineer | IoT + Prototyping | Arduino/ESP32 | 3D Printing | Trainer**

I build practical hardware + software prototypes—embedded firmware, sensors/IoT, and product-ready enclosures—then document them clearly so others can reproduce and improve them.

---

## What I do
- **Embedded & IoT prototyping:** Arduino / ESP32, sensors, displays, wireless communication  
- **Electronics engineering:** circuit design, debugging, testing, troubleshooting  
- **Prototyping for products:** 3D modeling + 3D printing (enclosures, mounts, jigs)  
- **Teaching & training:** Arduino, electronics basics, mechatronics concepts

---

## Featured work
- **NUBH** – Smart speed-alert & safety awareness device (ESP32 + ESP-NOW + OLED + CAN)  
- **IoT Water Monitoring System** – sensors + data + 3D printed housing  
- **Robotics electronics & control** – motor drivers, controllers, custom boards, prototypes  

> I keep my best projects documented with wiring, code, and clear demos.
